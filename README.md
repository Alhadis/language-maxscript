# MAXScript language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting to MAXScript files in Atom.

Originally [converted](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-converting-from-textmate) from the [MAXScript TextMate bundle](https://github.com/Alhadis/MAXScript.tmbundle), the source of which was shamelessly hocked from cb109's [sublime3dsmax plugin](https://github.com/cb109/sublime3dsmax).
